About this source code
----------------------

ESMS was initially written together with a friend as our first real software
project. We learned C while writing it, and frankly, this shows on parts of the
code. So, the initial version was quite a lopsided lump of C - which
nevertheless worked and did its job admirably. In later incarnations, when I
rewrote and added features, I switched to C++ and tried to make the code
cleaner, adhering to real programming practices. So the source code is a mash-up
of older C code and newer C++ code.
